Exeter Cycle Hire Analytics Project

This repository contains the raw data, code, and cleaned data for an MSc Business Analytics project analysing Transport for London (TfL) cycle hire data to inform the design of a potential sustainable mobility scheme for Exeter City Council.

## Project Overview
The project applies descriptive analytics and a simple predictive regression model to examine temporal demand patterns and differences in usage behaviour between classic bicycles and e-bikes. The analysis is intended to support early-stage strategic decision-making in a local authority context.

## Repository Contents
- `analysis/`: Python code used for data cleaning, aggregation, and regression analysis
- `raw_tfl_cycle_hire_data.zip`: Original, unmodified TfL cycle hire dataset
- `cleaned_cycle_hire_data.zip`: Cleaned dataset used for analysis, derived from the raw data
- `dashboard/`: Supporting files for visualisation and reporting 

## Data Source
All data used in this project is publicly available from Transport for London (TfL) Open Data.

## Reproducibility
The analysis can be reproduced by running the Python scripts/notebooks provided in the repository. Due to file size constraints, datasets are provided in compressed (ZIP) format.
